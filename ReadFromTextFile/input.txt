Working in the office is so safe. So safe in these walls.

Especially when you have to scan a programmed badge to open four different doors from the outside, through the hallways, to my desk.

So safe it is; the only worry being maybe someone bringing in a sickness from the outside and sneezing too close.

So safe it is; free from the worries of the outside, like the mindless violence that could happen at any instant.
